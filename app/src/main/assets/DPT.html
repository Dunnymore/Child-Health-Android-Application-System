<h1>Diphtheria Information</h1>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>What causes diphtheria?</strong> A type of bacteria called Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes diphtheria. The condition is typically spread through person-to-person contact or through contact with objects that have the bacteria on them, such as a cup or used tissue. You may also get diphtheria if you’re around an infected person when they sneeze, cough, or blow their nose.</p>

    <img src="file:///android_asset/images (2).jpeg" alt="Image Description">

    <p>People are also at an increased risk of contracting diphtheria if they:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>aren’t up to date on their vaccinations</li>
        <li>visit a country that doesn’t provide immunizations</li>
        <li>have an immune system disorder, such as AIDS</li>
        <li>live in unsanitary or crowded conditions</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why should DPT vaccine be given in the antero-lateral mid thigh and not the gluteal region (buttocks)?</p>
    <p class="answer">DPT is given in the antero-lateral mid thigh and not the gluteal region to prevent damage to the sciatic nerve. In addition, the vaccine deposited in the fat of gluteal region does not invoke the appropriate immune response.</p>
</div>

<img src="file:///android_asset/images (3).jpeg" alt="Image Description">

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why should there be a minimum gap of 4 weeks between 2 doses of DPT?</p>
    <p class="answer">This is because decreasing the interval between two doses may interfere with the antibody response and protection against the diseases.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">What should one do if a child is found allergic to DPT or develops encephalopathy after DPT?</p>
    <p class="answer">If a child is allergic or develops encephalopathy after DPT,he/she should be taken to a doctor immediately. Also the child should be given DT vaccine during the subsequent dose as it is usually the P (Pertussis) component of the vaccine which causes the allergy/encephalopathy.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">If a child has received DPT-1 but comes late for receiving DPT-2, should one restart with the fi rst dose of the vaccine?</p>
    <p class="answer">Do not start the schedule all over again even if the child is brought late for a dose. Pick up where the schedule was left off. For example: if a child has received BCG, DPT-1 and OPV-1 at 5 months of age and returns at 11 months of age, vaccinate the child with DPT-2, OPV-2 and Measles and do not start from DPT-1 again.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">If a child could not receive DPT 1, 2, 3 and OPV 1, 2, 3 as per the schedule, till what age can these vaccines be given?</p>
    <p class="answer">DPT vaccine can be given till 2 years of age and OPV can be given till 5 years of age.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">If a child who has never been vaccinated is brought for Immunization at 9 months of age, can all the due vaccines be given to him/her on the same day?</p>
    <p class="answer">Yes, all the due vaccines can be given during the same session but at different injection sites using separate AD syringes. It is safe and effective to give BCG, DPT,Hepatitis B, OPV and Measles vaccines and Vitamin A at the same time to a 9 months old child who has never been vaccinated.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">If the mother/caregiver permits administration of only one injection to a child who has come for Immunization at 9 months of age, which vaccine should be given?</p>
    <p class="answer">At 9 months of age, the priority is to give measles vaccine with OPV and Vitamin-A.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Which vaccines can be given to a child between 1-2 years of age, who has never been vaccinated?</p>
    <p class="answer">The child should be given DPT-1, OPV-1, Measles and 2ml of Vitamin A solution. He/ she should then be given the second and third doses of DPT and OPV at one month intervals till 2 years of age. The booster dose can be given at a minimum interval of 6 months after administering OPV-3/ DPT-3.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">If a child comes between the age of 2 to 5 years without having received any vaccine, what vaccines should be given?</p>
    <p class="answer">The child should be given two doses of DT with OPV with a minimum gap of 4 weeks (or 1 month). A single dose of measles vaccine also needs to be given with the first dose of DT.</p>
</div>

<h1>Whooping Cough Information</h1>
