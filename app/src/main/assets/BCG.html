<h1>BCG Vaccine Information</h1>

<p>BCG, or bacille Calmette-Guerin, is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. Many foreign-born persons have been BCG-vaccinated. BCG is used in many countries with a high prevalence of TB to prevent childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary disease.</p>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why is BCG vaccine given on the left upper arm only?</p>
    <p class="answer">Ans - BCG is given on the left upper arm to maintain uniformity and for helping surveyors in verifying the receipt of the vaccine (by checking the presence of a scar on the left upper arm).</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why do we give a lower dose (0.05 ml) of BCG to neonates below 1 month of age?</p>
    <p class="answer">Ans - This is because the skin of newborns is thin and an intradermal injection of 0.1ml may penetrate into the deeper tissue and may cause local abscess and enlarged axillary lymph nodes.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">If BCG vaccine is not given at birth, when should it be given?</p>
    <p class="answer">Ans - If not given at birth or along with DPT-1, then it should be given as early as possible. BCG can be given any time before 1 year of age.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why is BCG given only up to 1 year of age?</p>
    <p class="answer">Ans - This is because most children acquire natural clinical/sub-clinical tuberculosis infection by the age of 1 year. This too protects against severe forms of childhood tuberculosis.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">If no scar appears after administering BCG, should one revaccinate the child?</p>
    <p class="answer">Ans - There is no need to revaccinate the child if there is no scar.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why BCG vaccine is given at birth?</p>
    <p class="answer">Ans - It stands for Bacillus Calmette Gurrain, the strain of bovine tuberculosis used in the vaccine & attenuated by French scientists Calmette & Gurrain. BCG is given anytime from birth to 15 days of life along with the zero dose of oral polio vaccine.</p>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why do you get a scar from BCG?</p>
    <p class="answer">Ans - Both the Smallpox and BCG vaccines leave a scar on the upper arm. Your scar is from the BCG vaccine. We will explain how we know this and we will explain the BCG vaccine. Smallpox is a horrible disease that caused a scarring rash and killed many people.</p>
