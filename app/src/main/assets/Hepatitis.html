<h1>Hepatitis B Information</h1>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>WHO position on the use of hepatitis B vaccines:</strong> The main objective of hepatitis B immunization strategies is to prevent chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its serious consequences, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Routine vaccination of all infants against HBV infection should become an integral part of national immunization schedules worldwide. High coverage with the primary vaccine series among infants has the greatest overall impact on the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in children and should be the highest HBV-related priority.</p>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">How Do You Get Hepatitis B?</p>
    <p class="answer">Hepatitis B spreads through blood, semen, or other body fluids. Hepatitis B can spread from mother to child during birth — and when someone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Has sex with a person who has hepatitis B</li>
        <li>Shares drug needles with a person who has hepatitis B</li>
        <li>Shares a razor or toothbrush with a person who has hepatitis B</li>
        <li>Touches the blood or open sores of a person who has hepatitis B</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">What is hepatitis B?</p>
    <p class="answer">Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by a virus. There are 2 types of hepatitis B:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Acute (short-term) hepatitis B</li>
        <li>Chronic (long-term) hepatitis B</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many children who get acute hepatitis B don’t have any symptoms, but most adults do. Symptoms may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Feeling tired</li>
        <li>Upset stomach and throwing up</li>
        <li>Not feeling hungry</li>
        <li>Dark pee or clay-colored poop</li>
        <li>Pain in the muscles, joints, and stomach</li>
        <li>Jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Acute hepatitis B symptoms usually last a few weeks — but they can last as long as 6 months.</p>
    <p>If the acute hepatitis B infection does not go away after 6 months, it’s considered a chronic hepatitis B infection, which can lead to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cirrhosis (scarring of the liver)</li>
        <li>Liver cancer</li>
        <li>Liver failure</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">What is the “birth dose” of hepatitis B?</p>
    <p class="answer">This refers to the dose given within 24 hours of birth. A child vaccinated with Hep B after more than 24 hours of birth is not considered to have received the birth dose.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why is the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine given only within 24 hours of birth?</p>
    <p class="answer">The birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine is most effective in preventing peri-natal transmission of hepatitis B only if given within the first 24 hours.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Until what age can Hepatitis B vaccine be given?</p>
    <p class="answer">According to the National Immunization Schedule, Hepatitis B vaccine should be given with the first, second, and third doses of DPT till 1 year of age.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Can Hepatitis B vaccine be mixed in the same syringe with DPT and given as one injection?</p>
    <p class="answer">No, DPT and Hepatitis B vaccine (if supplied separately) cannot be mixed or administered through the same syringe.</p>
