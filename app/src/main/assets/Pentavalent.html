<h1>Pentavalent Vaccine Information</h1>

<div class="section">
    <p>The Pentavalent vaccine provides protection to a child from 5 life-threatening diseases – Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Hepatitis B, and Hib. DPT (Diptheria+Pertussis+Tetanus) and Hep B are already part of routine immunization in India; Hib vaccine is a new addition. Together, the combination is called Pentavalent.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Important things to remember:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Pentavalent vaccine will replace the current Hepatitis B and DPT primary vaccination schedule in the immunization programme.</li>
        <li>Hepatitis B birth dose will continue as before, in institutional birth within 24 hours of birth.</li>
        <li>DPT boosters at 16-24 months and 5-6 years will continue as before.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">What is Hib? What diseases does it cause?</p>
    <p class="answer">Hib is the abbreviation for Haemophilus influenzae type b, a bacterium that causes severe infections, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacterial meningitis – inflammation of the membranes that cover and protect the spinal cord and brain.</li>
        <li>Pneumonia – inflammation of the lungs.</li>
        <li>Septicaemia – presence of pathogenic bacteria in the blood.</li>
        <li>Septic arthritis – inflammation of the joints.</li>
        <li>Epiglottitis – inflammation of the area around the vocal cords and obstruction of the airway.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">How does the Hib infection spread?</p>
    <p class="answer">Hib bacteria are passed from child to child through droplets of saliva expelled when an infected child coughs or sneezes. Hib also spreads among children when they share toys and other things that they have put in their mouths.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Who can get Hib infections? Who is most at risk?</p>
    <p class="answer">Hib mostly affects children under five years of age, with children between four months and 18 months of age being most at risk. By the age of five years, most children have developed antibodies against the disease, hence serious diseases from Hib are uncommon in older children and adults.</p>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">How can Hib infections be prevented?</p>
    <p class="answer">Most Hib infections can only be prevented by the Hib vaccine.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">What are the limitations of the Hib vaccine?</p>
    <p class="answer">Hib vaccine protects only against diseases caused by the Hib bacterium. After Hib immunization, a child may still get pneumonia, meningitis, or flu caused by other bacteria and viruses.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Who should be immunized with the Hib vaccine?</p>
    <p class="answer">Generally, all children aged up to 1 year (after 6 weeks and less than 1 year) should receive the Hib vaccine as part of routine immunization.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">How many doses are needed? When should they be given?</p>
    <p class="answer">Three doses are given. The first dose is given as the Pentavalent vaccine only after a child is 6 weeks old. The second and third doses are given at 10 and 14 weeks of age respectively also in the form of Pentavalent vaccines. There is no booster dose recommended under UIP.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Why is Hib given as a Pentavalent vaccine and not separately?</p>
    <p class="answer">The schedule for DPT, Hep B, and Hib is the same at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. Therefore, if these three vaccines are given separately, a child gets three pricks at the same time. Giving a Pentavalent vaccine will reduce the number of pricks.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">A child who is 10 months old has not received any immunization. What are the vaccines that can be given to her?</p>
    <p class="answer">The child should receive BCG, measles, and the first dose of Pentavalent vaccines with OPV drops, and Vitamin A syrup.</p>
