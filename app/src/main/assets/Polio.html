<h1>Polio Vaccines Information</h1>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>Polio Vaccines:</strong> Both orally administered, live attenuated polio vaccines (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccines (IPV) for intramuscular (or subcutaneous) injection are widely used internationally. OPV has been the vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries, and for the global polio eradication initiative, because of the ease of oral administration, its superiority in conferring intestinal immunity in immunologically naive individuals, and its low cost.</p>
    <p>WHO also recommends that all countries currently using only OPV add at least 1 dose of IPV to the schedule. In polio-endemic countries and in countries at high risk for importation and subsequent spread, WHO also recommends an OPV dose at birth (also called 'zero dose'), followed by the primary series of 3 OPV doses and at least 1 IPV dose.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>IPV:</strong> The primary series consisting of 3 OPV doses plus 1 IPV dose can be initiated from the age of 6 weeks with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the OPV doses. If only 1 dose of IPV is used in the schedule, it should be given from 14 weeks of age (when maternal antibodies have diminished and immunogenicity is significantly higher) and can be co-administered with an OPV dose.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>There are two types of vaccine that protect against polio:</strong> inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). IPV is given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on the patient's age. Children get 4 doses of IPV at these ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and a booster dose at 4-6 years</p>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">What is IPV?</p>
    <p class="answer">IPV refers to Inactivated Polio Vaccine administered by injection. Evidence suggests that this vaccine, when used along with OPV, increases the protection to the individual as well as the community. IPV together with OPV prevents re-emergence and reinfection of wild poliovirus (WPV).</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Will IPV (injection) replace OPV (drops)?</p>
    <p class="answer">No, IPV (injection) will not replace OPV (polio drops), since IPV is recommended for administration in addition to OPV.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Is IPV better than OPV?</p>
    <p class="answer">IPV induces very low levels of immunity in the intestine. As a result, when a person immunized with IPV is infected with wild poliovirus, the virus can still multiply inside the intestines and be shed in the faeces, risking continued circulation. IPV is over five times more expensive than OPV.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">If not given at birth, when should OPV-0 be given?</p>
    <p class="answer">OPV-0 dose can be given up to 15 days after birth.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="question">Can an infant be breastfed immediately after OPV?</p>
    <p class="answer">Yes</p>

    <p class="question">A child has received 3 doses of OPV as per the immunization schedule. Should this child still be given a dose of OPV during the Pulse Polio Campaign?</p>
    <p class="answer">All children upto the age of 5 years should be given a dose of polio vaccine during the pulse polio campaign, even when they have need all the doses of
