<h1>Immunization Information</h1>

<h2>What is Immunization?</h2>

<img src="file:///android_asset/images.jpeg" alt="Image Description">

<p>Vaccination consists of introducing an agent (a bacterium, virus, or molecule) into the body that has been deprived of its pathogenicity (its ability to make you ill) but has kept its immunogenicity (its ability to induce an immune response). In case of subsequent contact with the pathogen agent, the body will be ready to defend itself, thus protecting the vaccinated individual against the disease.</p>

<h2>Why is Immunization Necessary?</h2>
<p>Immunization prevents illness, disability, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases including cervical cancer, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), pneumonia, polio, rotavirus diarrhea, rubella, and tetanus. Vaccination protects children from serious illness and complications of vaccine-preventable diseases. The purpose of the recommended immunization schedule is to protect infants and children by providing immunity early in life, before they are exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases.</p>

<h2>When do we call a child fully Immunized?</h2>
<p>A child is considered fully immunized when he/she has received one dose of BCG, three doses of DPT and OPV each, and one dose of measles by the age of 12 months.</p>

<h2>Why is it not advisable to clean the injection site with a spirit swab before vaccination?</h2>
<p>This is because some of the live components of the vaccine are killed if they come in contact with spirit.</p>

<h2>Vaccines under UIP</h2>
<p>Under UIP, following vaccines are provided:</p>
<ul>
    <li>BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin)</li>

    <li>Measles</li>
    <li>Hepatitis B</li>
    <li>TT (Tetanus Toxoid)</li>
    <li>JE vaccination (in selected high disease burden districts)</li>
    <li>Hib containing Pentavalent vaccine (DPT+HepB+Hib) (In selected States)</li>
</ul>
